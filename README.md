# Scale-of-Effect

This is a repository for sharing a dataset involving ant-plant relationships recorded within the Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve (n= 16 landscapes), Veracruz, Mexico. This dataset was previously published by our research group in Corro et al. (2019). 
Each line in the dataset represents an ecological interaction between a plant species and a ant species.
Which at each landscape, we made a 50 x 40 m quadrant (in which its center represented the centroid of the buffer) and walked recording all ants on plants that was accessible to the collector (from 0.5 m to 3 m high) and 10 meters apart to minimize the overestimation of abundant species and the effect of nest closeness. Specifically, we choose the first plant in a corner of each quadrant and recorded a plant every 10 m until the entire quadrant had been sampled. We placed 1 m2 blanket under the branches of each sampled plant and the foliage was then shaken to collect all ants that fell into the blanket. Field surveys were conducted between 9:00 am and 4:00 pm. In general, the types of biotic interactions involving ant–plant relationships are hard to classify in the field without performing specific experiments. Therefore, our ant-plant relationships represent a wide variety of biotic interactions, such as (i) mutualism (e.g., ant–plant protection systems), (ii) neutralism (e.g., ants using plants only as substrates for foraging and patrolling), (iii) antagonism (e.g., leaf-cutter ants), and (iv) complex indirect associations that can be considered both positive and negative.
